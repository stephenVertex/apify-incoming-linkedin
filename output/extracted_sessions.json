This is a powerful way to have an agent offload tasks to save on context while staying focused on a defined goal or series of tasks.\n\nIn this example I asked an agent to \"get the latest news from last Friday\": \n\n1. First, the agent got the current date and time to understand when \"last Friday\" was\n2. Then it fetched the latest AWS news\n3. From there it filtered for news relevant to Strands, AgentCore, MCP, and Agents\n4. After that the agent used the use_agent tool to have sub-agents review the content\n5. It also had the agents extract links to code samples and documentation\n6. Finally the agent provided a structured response\n\nI'll be demoing this live before re:Invent.
