Summary: AWS Lambda now supports Tenant Isolation, allowing for secure, isolated compute environments for individual customers within SaaS applications. This feature simplifies building multi-tenant applications by enabling isolation through a "tenant id" invocation, reducing the cost and complexity of maintaining separate environments.

# This is the biggest pre:Invent announcement so far. Multi-attribute GSI for DynamoDB is a huge win!
