    "text": "I have built a number of features and services in Amazon over the many years. Some of the most impactful ones make it easy to do something but every now and then we launch something that is totally a game changer that makes a previously \"almost\" impossible thing easy. I am specially proud of the team for Tenant Isolation in Lambda. Now you can build a SaaS and have secure environments for each of your customers as needed. Great for agents or  sensitive workloads where you don't want to share memory/CPU between your customers. Previously, you had to create isolated compute environments to achieve this which makes building this isolation exorbitantly expensive to run and maintain. Now you write a Lambda function and invoke it with a \"tenant id\" to get an isolated compute for that tenant. Easy as Lambda :). Read about it below and since we're already in re:Invent launch season, sign up for the Serverless events if you can - we are launching some other big things in a couple of weeks that you wouldn't want to miss!\n\nhttps://lnkd.in/gYHCbnht"
